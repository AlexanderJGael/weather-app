# Weather Dashboard: Implementation

This project entails the creation of a weather dashboard application. The application runs in the browser and features dynamic updates to HTML and CSS. 

The Weather Dashboard uses the OpenWeather API to fetch 5 Day weather forecast data for a particular city. The application requires the passed in parameters to be the coordinates of a city, which are retrieved by using the OpenWeatherMap APIs. 

## Key Features

- Option to search for city weather conditions.
- Presenting the user with current and future weather conditions for the searched city.
- Adding the searched city to the search history.
- Display the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index for current weather conditions.
- Present a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity for future weather conditions.
- Allow the user to click on a city in the search history and is then presented with current and future conditions for that city.
